		RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type_movie ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) as ranking
	FROM netflix
	GROUP BY 1,2
	) as t1
	WHERE ranking =1;
```
### 3. List all movies released in the year 2020

```sql

	from netflix
	GROUP BY country
	ORDER BY 
		total_content DESC
		LIMIT 5;
```


### 5. Find the Longest movie from the netflix data

```sql
	SELECT * FROM netflix
	WHERE
	 type_movie = 'Movie'
	 AND
	 duration = (SELECT MAX(duration) from netflix)
 ```


### 6. Find the Movies which are added in last 5 years
```sql
	SELECT 
		*
	FROM netflix
	WHERE 
		TO_DATE(date_added, 'Month DD, YYYY')>= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5 YEARS'

	SELECT CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5 YEARS'
```

```

### 10. Find the eah year and the average number of movies release by India on Netflix and return top 5 year with highest avg movies release
